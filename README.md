Trebuchet Contest: This is an Object-Orineted based project that uses for loops, 2D, 1D arrays, 
Constructors, and Objects to perform a trajectory calculation, and returns the best values i.e 
the values that lie between the min and max

Hangman: This is the classic game of hangman. I used Constructors, arrays, methods, if statements,
console input and output, and For loops to recreate this classic game. 

Monster Project: This is project has a simple objective of allowing user's to see and change monsters.
I used JOptionPane for input and output. For the monsters we used setters and getters methods to 
change the attributes, a constructor to access the getters and setters, and an ArrayList to store all
the monsters. For the function of the game I used Do, For, and If statements to run us through the program.
